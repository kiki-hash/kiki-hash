- 👋 Hi, I'm a cybersecurity vulnerability scanning engineer at a Fortune 500 company.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to use scripting for penetration testing, automation of processes, and improving security posture. Also I'm turning into an AI/ML junkie. Send help
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some basic pen testing skills and have mid programming experience. Very mid.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that will give me the experience I need to help develop tools for penetration testing.
- 📫 How to reach me : kiki_bash@protonmail.com (Yes, I'm aware of the difference between my userid on GitHub and my email. It's fine.)
